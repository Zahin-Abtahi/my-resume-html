<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
<ul>
    <li>I play the Cajon which boosts brain function around memory, problem-solving and executive thinking. Besides developing analytical skills, playing Cajon also improves my fine motor skills.</li>
    <li>I love listening to music. Creating an invigorating work playlist helps my mind focus when working on complex tasks.</li>
    <li>I love playing video games. It is one of the things I grew up with. Strategic gameplay can be an entertaining way of honing programming skills and improving brain functionality while decreasing stress and socializing.</li>
    <li>I am not a professional photographer but always tend to click pictures wherever I go. I enjoy the visual challenges of photography since coding can be a theoretical task that might not always have a visual component.</li>
    <li>Coding is a part of my life. I love coding and the main reason is I love to solve problems, and I find no better alternative than to code.</li>
